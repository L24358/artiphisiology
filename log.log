1. (O) Sanity check RF for AN and VGG16.
2. (O) Plot FOI vs maximal potential RF size for AN and VGG16.
3. Cross correlation for color and texture metric. (50,000 images: 200 images)
4. (O) FOI sanity check for vgg16 as well (with Wyeth's numbers).
5. Sanity check RF for ResNet.
6. Plot FOI vs max RF for Resnet18.
7. (O) Fix VGG16b.
8. Play with gdb and get_unit_by_rank if there's time.
9. Plot FOI vs layer depth (and percentage?).

### 20230513 ###
1. (O) Find RF for all nets.
2. (50%) OOI and DRI.
3. Gbp for other nets

### 20230510 ###
1. Run guided_backprop2, get_max_response, trace_unit5 for hkey = 6, 8.
2. "val" dataset is deleted, because of insufficient memory.
3. hkey=6 only gets to 

### 20230506 ###
1. (O) Finish running get_max_response.py (can see result from graphs, 127)
2. (O) Double check trace_unit5.py logic (this is done running)
3. (O) Think a bit about get_impact.py (similarity/clustering index)
4. Fix get_boundaries_wrap in calc.py
5. Finish and plot get_QRF.py

There are no "most important units"? (Try this for AlexNet, ResNet)

### 20230427 ###
1. ResNet
2. Guided backprop
3. Centering and unit size: circle slightly smaller than RF of Conv 5 (diameter = 32-93 pixels)
4. ipython doesn't work...

### 20230424 ###
1. Make sure that code is correct (with Wyeth)
2. One direction is to just look at different networks and say it's different (same analysis)
3. I think deconvolution is needed to say anything about this (try guided backprop)
4. Hopefully I can get to circuitry (that's my goal)

### 20230417 ###
Random Thoughts:

Can I draw a contribution graph?

What is the minimum circuitry for DRI?
--> Having a tanh function should acheive that. (There is no tanh)
--> All contributing units should have response values that are at \pm 1.
    --> If previous units are already DRI: trace upwards
    --> If not: check if they saturate
--> ReLU requires two layers to mimic tanh (one to cut from below, one from above)
    --> Find the layer that starts becoming not DRI.
    --> Check if that layer has opposite slopes for ReLU.
    --> Check if the scaled input falls into the "cut-off" regions, and yields the bias.
--> Made out of DRI units from earlier layer, perform deconv to see what they do
    
What is the minimum circuitry for OOI?
--> Having two units with opposite polarity but same response.
--> OOI can also be implemented via the mechanism above for DRI.

1. Think carefully about the metrics, run it on computer and upload it to github.

### TTD 041023 ###
1. New results are not pushed in this computer. (handytools, onoff related, range-len)

### TTD 040923 ###
1. (O) Fix dx, dy for outline --> done, passed visual sanity check, fixed up to fillhollow analysis (pre R2 fix)
2. (O) Self-defined r-squared value
    - Symmetric (O), through MSE
    - Bounded (X)
    - Scale-invariant (O), through division of standard deviation
3. (*) Dynamic range
4. (*) New model

### TTD 04062023 ###
1. (*) Read through slides and code the metrics
2. (O) Download the stimuli and make sure it works
3. (P) RF size calculation and comparison
4. (P) "Minimum circuitry" and how to test it:
    -- Tanh for "dynamic range insensitivity"
    -- ON + OFF convergence for "On-off invariance"

### Stimulus ###
* 225 Shape Stimulus; after that, texture
* "centered": Pasupathy stimulus is centered
* "rotated": Pasupathy stimulus is centered and rotated

### Data Aquisition ###
1. Run save_alexnet
2. Run plot_image (may need to un-comment the shift_dic parts)
3. Run plot_image2
4. Run get_response2

### Models ###
AlexNet:
VGG16: 3 8 11 13 16 18
ResNet: 3 5 7 9

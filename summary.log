### TTD 041223 ###
1. Think carefully about the metrics, run it on computer and upload it to github.

### TTD 041023 ###
1. New results are not pushed in this computer. (handytools, onoff related, range-len)

### TTD 040923 ###
1. (O) Fix dx, dy for outline --> done, passed visual sanity check, fixed up to fillhollow analysis (pre R2 fix)
2. (O) Self-defined r-squared value
    - Symmetric (O), through MSE
    - Bounded (X)
    - Scale-invariant (O), through division of standard deviation
3. (*) Dynamic range
4. (*) New model

### TTD 04062023 ###
1. (*) Read through slides and code the metrics
2. (O) Download the stimuli and make sure it works
3. (P) RF size calculation and comparison
4. (P) "Minimum circuitry" and how to test it:
    -- Tanh for "dynamic range insensitivity"
    -- ON + OFF convergence for "On-off invariance"

### Stimulus ###
* 225 Shape Stimulus; after that, texture
* "centered": Pasupathy stimulus is centered
* "rotated": Pasupathy stimulus is centered and rotated

### Data Aquisition ###
1. Run save_alexnet
2. Run plot_image (may need to un-comment the shift_dic parts)
3. Run plot_image2
4. Run get_response2

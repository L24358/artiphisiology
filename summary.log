Questions that I'm interested in
-------------------------------------------
1. What features are the units encoding?
    - This can be done using guided backpropagation (black magic)
    - What about on neural data? --> MID [*a], RF [*2]
2. What is the coding scheme for the networks?
    - For example, does it use hierarchical coding or sparse coding?
    - Hierarchical code: look at layer-by-layer receptive fields [*2,*b]
    - Sparse coding: do most responsive images elicit the same pre-synaptic inputs? [*1, *c] 
3. What are the circuitry mechanisms for certain units?


Arguments
-------------------------------------------
[*a] MID is the more "justified" approach compared to QRF, because MID is about maximizing a reasonable quantity,
    and QRF is the average of a black box output. 
[*b] Although directional selectivity or shape selectivity doesn't need to happen in a particular layer,
    it is perhaps advantageous that it does. (Then the downstream neurons can get what they need.)
[*c] Maybe images recruit different presynaptic neurons, and not the same ones consistently.

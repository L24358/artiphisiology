1. Make sure that code is correct (with Wyeth)
2. One direction is to just look at different networks and say it's different (same analysis)
3. I think deconvolution is needed to say anything about this (try guided backprop)
4. Hopefully I can get to circuitry (that's my goal)

Random Thoughts:

Can I draw a contribution graph?

What is the minimum circuitry for DRI?
--> Having a tanh function should acheive that. (There is no tanh)
--> All contributing units should have response values that are at \pm 1.
    --> If previous units are already DRI: trace upwards
    --> If not: check if they saturate
--> ReLU requires two layers to mimic tanh (one to cut from below, one from above)
    --> Find the layer that starts becoming not DRI.
    --> Check if that layer has opposite slopes for ReLU.
    --> Check if the scaled input falls into the "cut-off" regions, and yields the bias.
--> Made out of DRI units from earlier layer, perform deconv to see what they do
    
What is the minimum circuitry for OOI?
--> Having two units with opposite polarity but same response.
--> OOI can also be implemented via the mechanism above for DRI.

1. Think carefully about the metrics, run it on computer and upload it to github.

### TTD 041023 ###
1. New results are not pushed in this computer. (handytools, onoff related, range-len)

### TTD 040923 ###
1. (O) Fix dx, dy for outline --> done, passed visual sanity check, fixed up to fillhollow analysis (pre R2 fix)
2. (O) Self-defined r-squared value
    - Symmetric (O), through MSE
    - Bounded (X)
    - Scale-invariant (O), through division of standard deviation
3. (*) Dynamic range
4. (*) New model

### TTD 04062023 ###
1. (*) Read through slides and code the metrics
2. (O) Download the stimuli and make sure it works
3. (P) RF size calculation and comparison
4. (P) "Minimum circuitry" and how to test it:
    -- Tanh for "dynamic range insensitivity"
    -- ON + OFF convergence for "On-off invariance"

### Stimulus ###
* 225 Shape Stimulus; after that, texture
* "centered": Pasupathy stimulus is centered
* "rotated": Pasupathy stimulus is centered and rotated

### Data Aquisition ###
1. Run save_alexnet
2. Run plot_image (may need to un-comment the shift_dic parts)
3. Run plot_image2
4. Run get_response2

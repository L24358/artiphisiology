### TTD 040923 ###
1. Fix dx, dy for outline --> done, passed visual sanity check, fixed up to fillhollow analysis (pre R2 fix)
2. Self-defined r-squared value
    - Symmetric (O), through MSE
    - Bounded (X)
    - Scale-invariant (O), through division of standard deviation
3. Dynamic range

### TTD 04062023 ###
1. Read through slides and code the metrics
2. Download the stimuli and make sure it works
3. RF size calculation and comparison
4. "Minimum circuitry" and how to test it:
    -- Tanh for "dynamic range insensitivity"
    -- ON + OFF convergence for "On-off invariance"

### Stimulus ###
* 225 Shape Stimulus; after that, texture
* "centered": Pasupathy stimulus is centered
* "rotated": Pasupathy stimulus is centered and rotated
